Calibration of PTZ Cameras for Image-based Flow Measurement System
Authors: Jiacheng Wang, Zhen Zhang*, Ze Cheng

This document provides the code section related to camera calibration in the manuscript, including intrinsic parameters calibration, distortion correction, and extrinsic parameters calibration.

1. Intrinsic parameters calibration: Input nine photos of a chessboard pattern into the calibration_images folder.

2. Distrotion correction: Complete distortion correction according to the instructions.

3. Extrinsic parameters calibration: Enter the relevant measurement data as instructed to calculate the pitch angle of the PTZ camera.
